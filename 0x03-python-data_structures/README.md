# 0x03-Python Data Structures
Higher level programming day 4

## Tasks
### 1. Print a list of integers
    - Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
      - Conditions
        1. Format: one integer per line
        2. You are not allowed to import any module
        3. You are not allowed to cast integer to string
        4. You have to use `str.format()` to print integers

### 2. Secure access to an element in a list
    - Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
      - Conditions:
        1. Prototype: `def element_at(my_list, idx):`
        2. if idx is negative, the function should return `None`
        3. if idx is out of range(> of number of element in `my_list`), the function should return `None`
        4. You are not allowed to import any module
